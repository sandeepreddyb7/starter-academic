I am a research scientist at Leidos Research Support Team (LRST) which is involved in executing a mulit-year and multi-million dollar research service support (RSS) contract with Department of Energy (DOE) at [National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL)](https://netl.doe.gov),
pittsburgh. My work is primarily focused towards developing efficient methods for intelligent monitoring of natural gas pipelines at NETL as part of its multi-disciplinary research project, [natural gas infrastucture program](https://netl.doe.gov/oil-gas/ngi). This project carries a lot of national significance because it directly enables DOE to address the Nation‚Äôs energy challenges via innovative technological solutions, which will be developed at NETL as part of this contract. I am Part of a big collaborative team with people from diverse backgrounds and experiences. Technical lead and PoC for the development of digital twin of natural gas pipeline and directly responsible or all the efforts on combining A.I. with numerical simulations and experimental data.

In my work as a postdoctoral research scientist at [Max Planck Institute](https://www.mpi-magdeburg.mpg.de/person/114724/842836), Germany i was actively involved in developing  innovative methods for discovery of parsimonious nonlinear dynamical models using the concepts from scientific machine learning. I was also part of Max Planck research network on big data-driven material science [BiGmax](https://www.bigmax.mpg.de/scope). 
Prior to MPI, I worked as a research scientist at [TCOMS](https://www.tcoms.sg) under [Prof Chan Eng Soon](https://www.eng.nus.edu.sg/cee/staff/chan-eng-soon/) and developed fast and accurate methods for reconstruction and propagation of multidirectional ocean wave fields. My work at TCOMS broadly touched upon concepts ranging from compressed sensing, sparse representation, model order reduction, proper orthogonal decomposition, physics informed A.I and custom made ML networks such as Fourier neural operators. In my doctoral work under [Prof A R Magee](https://www.eng.nus.edu.sg/cee/staff/magee-allan-ross/) and [Prof R K Jaiman](https://mech.ubc.ca/rajeev-jaiman/), I focused on developing data-driven methods for stability analysis and prediction of fluid-structure interaction. As part of my PhD research, I pursued topics ranging from system identification, ERA, Recurrent neural networks, Convolutional neural networks, Proper orthogonal decompisition and data-driven reduced order models. 

I am always open for any kind of discussion on anything related to my work or any interesting ideas or topics. 

In addition to the above, i try to do... üèÉ ü•ã üèéÔ∏è üèè üé¶ in my free time.
